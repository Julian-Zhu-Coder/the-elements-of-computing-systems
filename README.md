_The Elements of Computing Systems_ Exercise Solutions

Solutions for computer-building book.
-------------------------------------

[_The Elements of Computing Systems_](http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/) is a book
that has the reader build a computer architecture in software, starting with
only a NAND and DFF gate and culminating in creating a Java-like OOP
programming language. Each chapter focuses on one layer of the architecture,
with the user building his own implementation at the chapter's end. Given the
book's expansive focus, its treatment of each topic is necessarily brief, but
it still succeeded in granting me an appreciation of how the simplest logical
elements give rise to the wonderful complexity of the modern computer.
Futhermore, the book demonstrated excellent use of test-driven development, for
test scripts accompanied each project, with the reader encouraged to iterate
until his implementation passes all tests.

My implementations of the book's earlier projects, such as rudimentary logic
gates and an arithmetical logic unit, are written in the book's own hardware
description language, with later projects, such as an assembler, developed in
Python.
